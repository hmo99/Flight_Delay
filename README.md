# Flight Delay

## Background
There are thousands of flight delays in the United States everyday.
Direct Aircraft Operating Cost is 74.2 $/min. Flight delays cost airlines billions of dollars every year.
It is important for the airlines to minimize flight delays.
This app can help the airline to better visualize flight delays.
